# Overview

<img src="/images/members.jpg" align="right">

The [Advanced AWS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AdvancedAWS/) is an independent group of over 1700 people who meet once a month in San Francisco. As a practitioner lead meetup, we have some very ambitious goals. Those are:

 -  Eat and drink
 -  Build a community of AWS users
 -  Share knowledge and learn something new
 -  Make new friends
 -  Have fun

## How Advanced is this meetup?

The simple answer is: **Not very**.

We make 2 assumptions:

 -  **You are already using AWS**

    It is not our job to sell you on AWS vs something else. That is Amazon's job. We expect our members to have already chosen AWS and want to learn how to take full advantage of it's awesomeness.

 -  **You know where the AWS documentation is**

    AWS has gigabytes of documentation, videos and tutorials. Doing an intro session on "What is EC2" would be redundant. Please enjoy the bootcamps at the [AWS Loft]((https://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/sf-loft/)) for those.

## Typical agenda:

6:00pm  Doors open. Food and drinks are served.<br />
6:30pm  Presentations start.<br />
8:30pm  Finish. Networking.<br />
9:00pm  Everyone out of the building.<br />

## What do we need?

Our group is entirely volunteer driven and relies on your involvement to make it a success. We are always looking for **speakers** and [**sponsors**](/sponsor/).
